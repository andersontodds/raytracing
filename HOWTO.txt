1. Download and install python e.g. use the Anaconda distribution https://www.continuum.io/downloads 
(It has all the required depedencies and all required libraries ready to go)

2. Download the entire source code consisting of:

- ray_main.py (main code)
- ray_fnct.py (functions used by the main code)
- ray_cmks.py (definitions of required physical constants)
- ray_plot.py (functions for plotting)
- ray_param.py (parameter file for the ray tracing)

3. Choose parameters for simulation in ray_param.dat

4. Open your command line and start ipython

5. In the ipython terminal execute "run ray_main.py"

6. Wait for the results to appear in a graphical windows
